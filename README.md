# Grokking-Deep-Learning

This repository is for the code and exercises that are available in the book "Grokking Deep Learning", [available here](https://manning.com/books/grokking-deep-learning?a_aid=grokkingdl&a_bid=32715258 "Grokking Deep Learning").
It is based on and uses large quantities of the code from the repository that accompanies the book, [linked here](https://github.com/iamtrask/Grokking-Deep-Learning)
